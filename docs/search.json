    "text": "In order to successfully give it a visual direction (I wouldn’t go so far as to say artistic), I have collected several references that I like and would eventually like to incorporate into this blog to give it a more personal touch than the basic Quarto theme, which I unfortunately find rather impersonal.\nMy primary reference is the film Escape from the 21st Century. I was particularly impressed by the framing and transitions when I watched it, and I thought it would work very well for my home page. I even think that if my skills allow it, integrating transitions between pages would be very beautiful."

    "text": "The New Year is often synonymous with good resolutions, which are all too often tragically accompanied by despair, resulting in failures tainted with regret, sadness and frustration at not having been able to live up to these ambitions.\nTo avoid this problem and not sacrifice my self-esteem once again on the hotel of productivity, I decided instead to make a Bingo card of goals I would like to achieve this year. It contains boxes with varying degrees of difficulty, including things I really want to do, others not so much, and some that I have been postponing for far too long now.\nThe aim of this bingo card is not necessarily to achieve everything this year, but rather to try to achieve some of the things and complete some of the lines.\nThus, I have wrote the following python code in order to generate a 5*4 bingo from a txt file.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib.table import Table\nimport textwrap\nimport random\n\n\ndef read_input(path): \n  with open(path) as f: \n    return f.read().splitlines()\n\n\ndef text_sizing(cell, text, max_font=11, min_font=0, max_chars=22): \n  wrapped = \"\\n\".join(textwrap.wrap(text, max_chars))\n  cell.get_text().set_text(wrapped)\n\n  lines = wrapped.count(\"\\n\") + 1\n  fontsize = max(min_font, max_font - (lines - 1) * 2)\n  cell.get_text().set_fontsize(fontsize)\n\n\ndef generate_bingo(lst):\n  rows, cols = 5, 4\n  max_cells = rows * cols\n\n  sentences = lst[:max_cells]\n  padded = sentences + [\"\"] * (max_cells - len(sentences))\n\n  table_data = [\n        padded[i * cols:(i + 1) * cols]\n        for i in range(rows)\n    ]\n\n  fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(19.35, 4)) # TODO: Check this \n  ax.axis(\"off\")\n\n  table = ax.table(\n        cellText=table_data,\n        loc=\"center\",\n        cellLoc=\"center\"\n    )\n\n  table.auto_set_font_size(False)\n  table.set_fontsize(14)\n  table.scale(2, 2.5)\n\n  bg_color = \"#000000\"      \n  cell_color = \"#222222\"    \n  text_color = \"#EEEEEE\"\n  edge_color = \"#000000\"\n  fig.patch.set_facecolor(bg_color)\n  \n  for (row, col), cell in table.get_celld().items():\n    cell.set_facecolor(cell_color)\n    cell.set_edgecolor(edge_color)\n    cell.set_linewidth(1.5)\n    cell.set_text_props(\n      color=text_color,\n      fontsize=7,\n      fontfamily=\"monospace\",\n      ha=\"center\",\n      va=\"center\",\n      wrap=True\n    )\n\n  for cell, text in zip(table.get_celld().values(), padded):\n    text_sizing(cell, text)\n  \n  plt.tight_layout()\n\n  return fig\n\n\ndef update_bingo(fig, finish): \n  ax = fig.axes[0]\n  table = None\n  for child in ax.get_children():\n    if isinstance(child, Table):\n      table = child\n      break\n  for (row, col), cell in table.get_celld().items():\n    cell_text = cell.get_text().get_text()\n    cell_text = cell_text.replace(\"\\n\", \" \").strip()\n    if cell_text in finish:\n      cell.set_facecolor(\"#BD4E58\")\n      cell.get_text().set_weight(\"bold\")\n  fig.canvas.draw_idle()\n  return fig\n\n\nrandom.seed(655321)\n\nlst = read_input('bingo.txt')\nrandom.shuffle(lst)\n\nfig = generate_bingo(lst)\n\n# Update\nfinish = ['Meet Nicolas']\nif len(finish) &gt; 0: \n  fig = update_bingo(fig, finish)\n\nplt.show()"
